# Not Your Typical Mask Detector

This is an **Extended Version** of the typical mask detector. 

This project initially is the same as the other mask detection projects, however after checking for a mask, if a person is not wearing a mask, it uses face recognition to identify the person and gets his details from the **PostgreSQL** database and e-mails him/her an acknowledgement for it.
